I mostly used openCV and YOLO to solve these tasks.
OpenCV is an open-source software library that provides tools and algorithms for image and video processing, including features like object detection, tracking, and recognition. It's widely used in various applications, from robotics to augmented reality, due to its versatility and efficiency.
YOLO is a popular object detection algorithm known for its speed and accuracy. Unlike traditional detection methods, YOLO predicts multiple object bounding boxes and their corresponding class probabilities directly in a single forward pass. This makes it well-suited for real-time applications such as video surveillance and autonomous driving.
